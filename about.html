            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Head Space and Sanity Kenya(HSSK) is raising awareness on the relevance of mental wellness especially among the youth in Kenya. Our youth face many challenges ranging from unemployment to pressure from both family and friends. We are working towards acquainting the youth on how to go about depression, putting on mind that it is normal to have both highs and lows and opening up to someone is the way to go.</p>
